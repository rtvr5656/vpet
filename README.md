The pet has 2 movements systems:

1 - walk left to right

2 - walk to all directions (left, right, up and down)

- It's possible to change on the script if the pet has gravity or not

- It's **recommended** to use gravity if the pet is with the 1st movement system, and to not use the gravity when it's on the 2nd movement system

- The pet can "talk" (appears a message on the top of his head) when clicked on him. The messages can be changed on the script

You can change the sprites and animations in the AnimatedSprite node
